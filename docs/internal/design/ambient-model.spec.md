# Ambient Platform Data Model Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** Proposed — Pending Consensus
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-28 — added `ScheduledSession` Kind; added session operational sub-resources (workspace, files, git, repos, tasks, runner protocol); added generic proxy surface for backend passthrough; updated coverage matrix: all ScheduledSession commands implemented; session sub-resources (workspace/files/git/repos/operational/runner protocol) implemented in API server; generic proxy plugin implemented; added `SessionEvent` Kind (durable AG-UI event store replacing `agui-events.jsonl`); clarified `SessionMessage` as runner inbox only; added `/agui/events` SSE endpoint with compaction and `since`/`run_id` filters
**Guide:** `ambient-model.guide.md` — implementation waves, gap table, build commands, run log
**Design:** `credentials-session.md` — full Credential Kind design spec and rationale

## Overview

The Ambient API server provides a coordination layer for orchestrating fleets of persistent agents across projects. The model is intentionally simple:

- **Project** — a workspace. Groups agents and provides shared context (`prompt`) injected into every agent start.
- **Agent** — a project-scoped, mutable definition. Agents belong to exactly one Project. `prompt` defines who the agent is and is directly editable (subject to RBAC).
- **Session** — an ephemeral Kubernetes execution run, created exclusively via agent start. Only one active Session per Agent at a time.
- **SessionEvent** — a single AG-UI protocol event in the LLM conversation. Append-only; the canonical record of what happened in a session. Stored in the `session_events` table; replaces `agui-events.jsonl`.
- **Inbox** — a persistent message queue on an Agent. Messages survive across sessions and are drained into the start context at the next run.
- **Credential** — a project-scoped secret. Stores a Personal Access Token or equivalent for an external provider (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Google). Consumed by runners at session start. All agents in the project share the project's credentials automatically.
- **RoleBinding** — binds a Resource to a Role at a given scope (`global`, `project`, `agent`, `session`). Ownership and access for all Kinds is expressed through RoleBindings.

The stable address of an agent is `{project_name}/{agent_name}`. It holds the inbox and links to the active session.

## Agent — Project-Scoped Mutable Definition

Agent is scoped to a Project. The stable address is `{project_name}/{agent_name}`.

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Human-readable, unique within the project. Used as display name and in addressing. |
| `prompt` | Defines who the agent is. Mutable via PATCH. Access controlled by RBAC (`agent:editor` or higher). |
| `current_session_id` | Denormalized FK to the active Session. Null when no session is running. Used by Project Home for fast reads. |

**Agent is mutable.** PATCH updates in place. There is no versioning. If you need to track prompt history, use `labels`/`annotations` or an external audit log.

```
POST /projects/{id}/agents          → create agent in this project
PATCH /projects/{id}/agents/{id}    → update agent (name, prompt, labels, annotations)
GET /projects/{id}/agents/{id}      → read agent
DELETE /projects/{id}/agents/{id}   → soft delete
```

Only one active Session per Agent at a time. Start is idempotent — if an active session exists, start returns it. If not, a new session is created.

---

## Inbox — Persistent Message Queue

Inbox messages are addressed to an Agent (`agent_id`). They are distinct from Session Messages:

| | Inbox | SessionMessage |
|--|-------|----------------|
| Scope | Agent (persists across sessions) | Session (ephemeral) |
| Created by | Human or another Agent | Human user (API or CLI) |
| Drained | At session start | Never — append-only queue |
| Purpose | Queued intent waiting for next run | User message delivery to runner |

At session start, all unread Inbox messages are drained: marked `read=true` and injected as context into the Session prompt before the first SessionMessage turn.

---

## Session — Ephemeral Run

Sessions are **not directly creatable**. They are run artifacts created exclusively via `POST /projects/{project_id}/agents/{agent_id}/start`.

`Session.prompt` scopes the task for this specific run — separate from `Agent.prompt` which defines who the agent is.

```
Project.prompt  → "This workspace builds the Ambient platform API server in Go."
Agent.prompt    → "You are a backend engineer specializing in Go APIs..."
Inbox messages  → "Please also review the RBAC middleware while you're in there"
Session.prompt  → "Implement the session messages handler. Repo: github.com/..."
```

All four are assembled into the start context in that order. Pokes roll downhill.

---

## SessionMessage — Runner Delivery Queue (User Messages Only)

SessionMessages are the delivery queue for user-to-runner messages. They carry only `event_type="user"`. The runner's `WatchSessionMessages` gRPC stream watches this table and filters to `event_type="user"` — any other event_type is discarded by the watcher.

`seq` is monotonically increasing within a session. SessionMessages are append-only and never deleted.

**SessionMessages do not store assistant outputs, tool calls, or any other AG-UI events.** Those are stored in `SessionEvent`. The overloading of `session_messages` as both a delivery queue and an event log is superseded by this separation — `grpc_push_middleware` and `GRPCMessageWriter` must write to `SessionEvent`, not `SessionMessage`.

### Event Streams

| Endpoint | Source | Persistence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /sessions/{id}/messages` | Human or system | DB append | Deliver a user message to the runner |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/messages` | API server DB | Persisted | List user messages sent to this session |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events` | API server DB + runner | Persisted (see SessionEvent) | Durable AG-UI event replay + live stream |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/events` | Runner pod SSE | Ephemeral; runner-local | Live AG-UI turn events during an active run |

The runner's `/events/{thread_id}` endpoint registers an asyncio queue into `bridge._active_streams[thread_id]` and streams every AG-UI event as SSE until `RUN_FINISHED` / `RUN_ERROR` or client disconnect. The API server's `/sessions/{id}/events` proxies this from the runner pod for the active session, routing via pod IP or session service. Keepalive pings fire every 30s to hold the connection open. The `/sessions/{id}/agui/events` endpoint provides the same stream with durable replay — see `SessionEvent` below.

---

## SessionEvent — Durable AG-UI Event Store

SessionEvents are the canonical append-only record of every AG-UI protocol event in a session. They replace `agui-events.jsonl` (the legacy backend PVC file) and the overloaded non-user event rows that `grpc_push_middleware` previously wrote to `session_messages`.

Every AG-UI event emitted by the runner is persisted here. Complete event type set (authoritative source: `components/backend/types/agui.go`):

| Category | Event Types |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle | `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_FINISHED`, `RUN_ERROR` |
| Steps | `STEP_STARTED`, `STEP_FINISHED` |
| Text (streaming) | `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` |
| Tool calls (streaming) | `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_ARGS`, `TOOL_CALL_END`, `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` |
| Reasoning (streaming) | `REASONING_START`, `REASONING_END`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_START`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` |
| Snapshots | `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT`, `STATE_SNAPSHOT`, `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` |
| Deltas (streaming) | `STATE_DELTA`, `ACTIVITY_DELTA` |
| Platform | `META`, `CUSTOM`, `RAW` |

This type list matches `components/backend/types/agui.go` (the Go authoritative source). `THINKING_*` event types present in some versions of the `ag_ui` Python library are deprecated and excluded from `session_events`. `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` is accepted — the installed `ag_ui` 0.1.18 defines `ToolCallResultEvent` with `message_id`, `tool_call_id`, and `content` fields.

`run_id` and `thread_id` are first-class columns — they group events within a runner invocation and tie back to the runner's in-memory stream. `seq` is a global BIGSERIAL (not per-session unique) — the `(session_id, seq)` index enables ordered per-session replay without a per-session sequence generator. The `payload` column stores the raw AG-UI event JSON verbatim; the SSE replay endpoint pipes it directly as `data: {payload}\n\n` without transformation, producing a standards-compliant AG-UI SSE stream.

### Compaction

After `RUN_FINISHED` or `RUN_ERROR`, streaming delta rows for that `run_id` are marked `superseded=true` and replaced by terminal snapshot rows:

| Superseded (streaming deltas) | Snapshot that replaces it |
|---|---|
| `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `TOOL_CALL_ARGS`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` |
| `STATE_DELTA` | `STATE_SNAPSHOT` |
| `ACTIVITY_DELTA` | `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` |

Compaction steps:
1. `UPDATE session_events SET superseded = true WHERE session_id = ? AND run_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM ? AND event_type IN ('TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT', 'TOOL_CALL_ARGS', 'REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT', 'STATE_DELTA', 'ACTIVITY_DELTA')`
   (`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` handles nullable `run_id` correctly — standard `= ?` evaluates to NULL when `run_id` is NULL and matches nothing.)
2. `INSERT` a `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` row with `superseded = false` — the canonical assembled transcript for the run.
3. If state was tracked, `INSERT` a `STATE_SNAPSHOT` row; if activity was tracked, `INSERT` an `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` row.

SSE replay excludes `superseded=true` rows (`WHERE NOT superseded`). Non-delta events (`STEP_STARTED`, `STEP_FINISHED`, `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_END`, lifecycle events) are never marked superseded — they are always included in replay.

This mirrors the `compactFinishedRun()` behavior from the legacy backend (`agui_store.go`) but operates within the database rather than on the filesystem, eliminating the atomic-rename requirement and the per-session filesystem mutex. The legacy code preserves `AskUserQuestion` TOOL_CALL_START events specifically for `DeriveAgentStatus()` — the new compaction never touches START events, so this behavior is preserved by default.

### Write Paths

| Source | Mechanism | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Backend AG-UI proxy | Writes one row per event as it proxies the runner SSE stream | Operator-based sessions |
| Runner (control-plane sessions) | gRPC `PushSessionEvent` — all events via `grpc_push_middleware` | Control-plane sessions |

`grpc_push_middleware` must be updated to call `PushSessionEvent` instead of `PushSessionMessage`. The `GRPCMessageWriter` (which wrote the final assistant text to `session_messages`) is retired — the full event stream in `session_events` supersedes it.

**Proto contract:** The `PushSessionEvent` RPC must be added to `sessions.proto`. The request message must include `run_id` and `thread_id` as string fields — passed from `RunAgentInput` at the `run.py` call site (see Migration Paths for signature details). After editing the proto, run `buf generate` from the `proto/` directory to regenerate `sessions.pb.go` and `sessions_grpc.pb.go`. The `PushSessionEvent` method must then be implemented on the `sessionGRPCHandler` struct in `grpc_handler.go`.

```proto
message PushSessionEventRequest {
  string session_id = 1;
  string run_id     = 2;  // groups events within a runner invocation
  string thread_id  = 3;  // ties to runner in-memory stream
  string event_type = 4;
  string payload    = 5;  // raw AG-UI event JSON; must use camelCase (by_alias=True in model_dump)
}
message PushSessionEventResponse {
  int64 seq = 1;  // server-assigned sequence number; enables ?since=<seq> reconnect cursor
}
rpc PushSessionEvent(PushSessionEventRequest) returns (PushSessionEventResponse);
```

**Payload encoding:** `_event_to_payload()` in `grpc_push.py` currently calls `event.model_dump()` without `by_alias=True` — this produces snake_case field names instead of camelCase. Must be fixed to `event.model_dump(by_alias=True)` before `PushSessionEvent` is wired up, otherwise SSE consumers receive malformed AG-UI events.

**Write throughput:** Individual row inserts are acceptable for initial implementation. At high session volume (>10 concurrent active sessions at 20 events/sec each), batch inserts via a buffered channel in the gRPC handler can be adopted without changing the proto contract.

### Indexes

```sql
-- Required: ordered per-session replay (all queries use this)
CREATE INDEX idx_session_events_session_seq ON session_events(session_id, seq);

-- Required: per-run queries (?run_id= filter and compaction UPDATE)
CREATE INDEX idx_session_events_session_run ON session_events(session_id, run_id);

-- Optional: replay optimization (partial index skips superseded rows without full scan)
CREATE INDEX idx_session_events_replay ON session_events(session_id, seq) WHERE NOT superseded;
```

`seq` is a global BIGSERIAL — no per-session UNIQUE constraint. The `(session_id, seq)` index provides ordered per-session reads. `seq` values are not contiguous within a session (global monotone), but they form a stable cursor for `?since=<seq>` reconnect.

### DDL and Migration

The full `CREATE TABLE` DDL for `session_events` (mirrors the `session_messages` migration pattern):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS session_events (
    id          VARCHAR(36)  PRIMARY KEY,               -- KSUID assigned by server
    session_id  VARCHAR(36)  NOT NULL,
    run_id      TEXT,                                   -- nullable; groups events per runner invocation
    thread_id   TEXT,                                   -- nullable; ties to runner in-memory stream
    seq         BIGSERIAL    NOT NULL,                  -- global monotone; not per-session unique
    event_type  TEXT         NOT NULL,
    payload     TEXT         NOT NULL,                  -- raw camelCase AG-UI event JSON
    superseded  BOOLEAN      NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,    -- true = streaming delta replaced by snapshot
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

No `updated_at` or `deleted_at` columns — `session_events` is append-only and never updated in place (compaction sets `superseded=true`, it does not update other columns).

**Migration registration:** Add a `sessionEventsMigration()` function to `plugins/sessions/migration.go` following the existing pattern (with `ID: "YYYYMMDDHHMI"` timestamp and a `Rollback` func that drops indexes then the table). Register it in `plugin.go`'s `init()` via `db.RegisterMigration(sessionEventsMigration())` alongside the existing calls. The rollback must drop indexes before the table:

```go
Rollback: func(tx *gorm.DB) error {
    stmts := []string{
        `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_session_events_replay`,
        `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_session_events_session_run`,
        `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_session_events_session_seq`,
        `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS session_events`,
    }
    for _, s := range stmts { tx.Exec(s) }
    return nil
},
```

### Read Paths

| Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events` | SSE: replay all non-superseded rows from `seq=0`, then stream live events |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events?since=<seq>` | SSE: replay from `seq` (reconnect without full history) |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events?run_id=<id>` | SSE: all events for a single run (debugging, per-run transcript) |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events?limit=<n>` | SSE: cap replay to last N non-superseded rows (pagination; default unlimited) |

The `since` parameter enables seamless client reconnect: the client tracks the last `seq` it received, reconnects with `?since=<seq>`, and receives only new events — no full replay.

**Live-tail mechanism:** The SSE handler uses PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` for cross-replica fan-out:

1. **Subscribe**: Issue `LISTEN session_<session_id>` on a dedicated DB connection before beginning replay.
2. **Replay**: Query and emit all non-superseded rows `WHERE session_id = ? AND seq > ?` ordered by `seq`. Track the highest `seq` emitted.
3. **Drain**: Flush any `NOTIFY` payloads buffered during replay. Discard those with `seq ≤ last_replayed_seq` to prevent duplicates.
4. **Live**: Forward subsequent `NOTIFY` payloads directly to the SSE client as they arrive.

The `PushSessionEvent` gRPC handler sends `NOTIFY session_<session_id> '<payload>'` immediately after each `INSERT`. Keepalive pings fire every 30 s to hold the SSE connection open. This fan-out works across API server replicas because `NOTIFY` is broadcast to all `LISTEN`ers on that PostgreSQL channel, regardless of which replica they connect from.

**RBAC:** `GET /sessions/{id}/agui/events` requires at minimum `agent:observer` on the parent agent or `project:viewer` on the parent project — same as `GET /sessions/{id}`. `PushSessionEvent` gRPC is restricted to service callers — the bearer token interceptor's `middleware.IsServiceCaller(ctx)` check must pass (token matches `expectedToken` or the JWT username matches the configured service account). Human users and CLI callers cannot call `PushSessionEvent` directly.

**Retention:** No automatic row deletion is defined in this spec. Table growth is bounded by session count × events per session. For high-volume deployments, a background job can delete `superseded=true` rows older than N days — the `superseded` flag enables this without API changes. This is a future operational concern.

### Migration Paths

**`DeriveAgentStatus()`** (`components/backend/websocket/agui_store.go`, wired at `main.go:204`): Currently tail-scans `agui-events.jsonl`. Must be ported to query `session_events` with an event-type filter (not a row LIMIT, which is insufficient for high-event sessions):
```sql
SELECT event_type, payload FROM session_events
WHERE session_id = ?
  AND NOT superseded
  AND event_type IN ('RUN_STARTED', 'RUN_FINISHED', 'RUN_ERROR', 'TOOL_CALL_START')
ORDER BY seq DESC
LIMIT 20
```
Apply the same state machine: `RUN_STARTED` → `working`; `RUN_FINISHED`/`RUN_ERROR` → `idle`; `TOOL_CALL_START` where the tool name matches `AskUserQuestion` → `waiting_input`. The tool name comparison is **case-insensitive and strips all non-alphabetic characters** before comparing (matching the existing `isAskUserQuestionToolCall()` behavior in `agui_store.go`). Until the legacy backend is removed, both paths run in parallel — the backend reads JSONL, the API server reads `session_events`.

**`AGUIEvents` handler** (`handler.go:644-692`): Currently proxies the runner's live SSE stream directly with no DB backing. Must be replaced to: (1) replay non-superseded `session_events` rows ordered by `seq`, (2) subscribe to the in-memory fan-out channel for live events. Add `?since` and `?run_id` query parameter parsing. The existing ephemeral `GET /sessions/{id}/events` endpoint remains unchanged.

**`StreamTextMessages()`** (`message_handler.go:144`): Currently filters `TEXT_MESSAGE_*` from `session_messages`. Must be updated to query `session_events WHERE event_type IN ('TEXT_MESSAGE_START', 'TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT', 'TEXT_MESSAGE_END') AND session_id = ? ORDER BY seq` and registered as a route in `plugin.go`. This endpoint becomes the `acpctl session messages` data source — the CLI reconstructs the human-readable conversation from `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas in `seq` order. The ephemeral `GET /sessions/{id}/events` runner-proxy endpoint is unchanged and still available for live-only consumption.

**`grpc_push_middleware`** (`ambient_runner/middleware/grpc_push.py`): Replace the `session_messages.push()` call with a new `session_events.push()` gRPC call. Extend the function signature to accept `run_id` and `thread_id` as optional keyword arguments: `grpc_push_middleware(stream, *, session_id=None, run_id=None, thread_id=None)`. The call site in `run.py` passes them from `RunAgentInput.run_id` and `RunAgentInput.thread_id`. The runner-side gRPC client also requires a new `SessionEventsAPI` class (analogous to `_session_messages_api.py`) and a `session_events` property on `AmbientGRPCClient`. Fix `_event_to_payload()` to use `event.model_dump(by_alias=True)` to produce camelCase JSON (this bug also affects the current `session_messages` write path).

**`GRPCMessageWriter`** (`grpc_transport.py`): Retired. The full event stream in `session_events` supersedes the final-text-only write to `session_messages`. The writer's `_write_message()` method (called on `RUN_FINISHED` and `RUN_ERROR`) and the `_synthesize_run_error()` function (which creates `GRPCMessageWriter` objects directly) must both be updated or removed together — retiring `GRPCMessageWriter` without updating `_synthesize_run_error` will cause a runtime error in the error path. `GRPCMessageWriter` retirement must be deployed atomically in the same release as `PushSessionEvent` going live — removing it before `session_events` is available leaves control-plane sessions with no durable write path.

**Implementation checklist for `PushSessionEvent`:**
1. Add proto definition to `sessions.proto`
2. Run `buf generate` from `proto/` to regenerate `sessions.pb.go` and `sessions_grpc.pb.go`
3. Implement `PushSessionEvent` method on `sessionGRPCHandler` in `grpc_handler.go` (guarded by `middleware.IsServiceCaller`)
4. Add `sessionEventsMigration()` to `migration.go` and register it in `plugin.go`
5. Write `SessionEventsAPI` class in runner (`_session_events_api.py`) and add `session_events` property to `AmbientGRPCClient`
6. Extend `grpc_push_middleware` signature and update call site in `run.py`
7. Retire `GRPCMessageWriter` and update `_synthesize_run_error` in same PR

**`session_messages` narrowing:** Existing non-user rows in `session_messages` (written by `grpc_push_middleware` and `GRPCMessageWriter` before this split) should be purged or migrated during the cutover migration. A `CHECK (event_type = 'user')` constraint can then be added to enforce the new contract at the schema level.

## ScheduledSession — Recurring Agent Trigger

A `ScheduledSession` is a project-scoped definition that ignites an Agent on a recurring cron schedule. Each trigger creates a new Session with `session_prompt` injected as the task scope for that run.

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Human-readable, unique within the project. |
| `agent_id` | Which Agent to ignite. Must exist in the same project. |
| `schedule` | Standard cron expression (e.g. `"0 9 * * 1-5"` = 9 AM on weekdays). |
| `timezone` | IANA timezone string (e.g. `"America/New_York"`). Defaults to `UTC`. |
| `enabled` | `false` suspends evaluation without deleting the schedule. |
| `session_prompt` | Injected as `Session.prompt` on each trigger — the recurring task. |
| `last_run_at` | Wall-clock time of the last trigger. Null if never triggered. |
| `next_run_at` | Computed from `schedule` + `timezone`. Updated after each trigger. |

**Trigger semantics:** Each trigger calls `POST /projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/start`, which is idempotent. If the Agent already has an active Session at trigger time, the trigger is skipped and recorded as a missed run in the runs list.

**Manual trigger:** `POST .../trigger` ignites the Agent immediately outside the cron schedule, using the same `session_prompt`. Useful for testing or one-off runs.

**Suspend / Resume:** `POST .../suspend` sets `enabled=false`; `POST .../resume` sets `enabled=true`. These are named convenience actions equivalent to `PATCH {enabled: false|true}`.

### `acpctl apply` — Declarative Fleet Management

`acpctl apply` reconciles Projects and Agents from declarative YAML files, mirroring `kubectl apply` semantics. It is the primary way to provision and update entire agent fleets from the `.ambient/teams/` directory tree.

#### Supported Kinds

| Kind | Fields applied |
|---|---|
| `Project` | `name`, `description`, `prompt`, `labels`, `annotations` |
| `Agent` | `name`, `prompt`, `labels`, `annotations`, `inbox` (seed messages) |
| `Credential` | `name`, `description`, `provider`, `token` (env var reference), `url`, `email`, `labels`, `annotations` — created in current project context |

`Agent` resources in `.ambient/teams/` files also carry an `inbox` list of seed messages. On apply, any message in the list is posted to the agent's inbox if an identical message (same `from_name` + `body`) does not already exist there.

#### `-f` — File or Directory

```sh
acpctl apply -f <file>               # apply a single YAML file
acpctl apply -f <dir>                # apply all *.yaml files in the directory (non-recursive)
acpctl apply -f -                    # read from stdin
```

Each file may contain one or more YAML documents separated by `---`. Documents with unrecognised `kind` values are skipped with a warning.

Apply behaviour per resource:
- **Project**: if a project with `name` already exists, `PATCH` it (description, prompt, labels, annotations). If it does not exist, `POST` to create it.
- **Agent**: resolved within the current project context. If an agent with `name` already exists in the project, `PATCH` it (prompt, labels, annotations). If it does not exist, `POST` to create it. After upsert, post any inbox seed messages not already present.

Output (default — one line per resource):

```
project/ambient-platform configured
agent/lead configured
agent/api created
agent/fe created
```

With `-o json`: JSON array of all applied resources.

#### `-k` — Kustomize Directory

```sh
acpctl apply -k <dir>                # build kustomization in <dir> and apply the result
```

Equivalent to: build the kustomization (resolve `bases`, `resources`, merge `patches`) into a flat manifest stream, then apply each document in order.

The kustomization schema is a subset of Kubernetes Kustomize, restricted to the fields meaningful for Ambient resources:

```yaml
kind: Kustomization

resources:           # relative paths to YAML files included in this build
  - project.yaml
  - lead.yaml

bases:               # other kustomization directories to include first
  - ../../base

patches:             # strategic-merge patches applied after resource collection
  - path: project-patch.yaml
    target:
      kind: Project
      name: ambient-platform
  - path: agents-patch.yaml
    target:
      kind: Agent   # no name = apply to all Agent resources
```

Patches use **strategic merge**: scalar fields overwrite, maps merge, sequences replace.

Output is identical to `-f`.

#### Examples

```sh
# Apply the full base fleet
acpctl apply -f .ambient/teams/base/

# Apply the dev overlay (resolves base + patches)
acpctl apply -k .ambient/teams/overlays/dev/

# Apply a single agent file
acpctl apply -f .ambient/teams/base/lead.yaml

# Dry-run: show what would change without applying
acpctl apply -k .ambient/teams/overlays/prod/ --dry-run

# Pipe from stdin
cat lead.yaml | acpctl apply -f -
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-f <path>` | File, directory, or `-` for stdin. Mutually exclusive with `-k`. |
| `-k <dir>` | Kustomize directory. Mutually exclusive with `-f`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print what would be applied without making API calls. |
| `-o json` | JSON output (array of applied resources). |
| `--project <name>` | Override project context for Agent resources. |

#### Status column

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `created` | Resource did not exist; POST succeeded. |
| `configured` | Resource existed; PATCH applied one or more changes. |
| `unchanged` | Resource existed and matched desired state; no API call made. |

#### CLI reference row additions

| Command | Status |
|---|---|
| `acpctl apply -f <path>` | ✅ implemented |
| `acpctl apply -k <dir>` | ✅ implemented |

### Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` | Skip TLS certificate verification |
| `-o json` | JSON output (most `get`/`create` commands) |
| `-o wide` | Wide table output |
| `--limit <n>` | Max items to return (default: 100) |
| `-w` / `--watch` | Live watch mode (sessions only) |
| `--watch-timeout <duration>` | Watch timeout (default: 30m) |

### Project Context

The CLI maintains a current project context in `~/.acpctl/config.yaml` (also overridable via `AMBIENT_PROJECT` env var). Most operations that require `project_id` read it from context automatically.

```sh
acpctl login https://api.example.com --token $TOKEN
acpctl project my-project
acpctl get sessions
acpctl create agent --name overlord --prompt "You coordinate the fleet..."
acpctl start overlord
```

## API Reference

### Projects

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects                              list projects
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects                              create project
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}                         read project
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}                         update project
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}                         delete project

GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/role_bindings           RBAC bindings scoped to this project
```

### Agents (Project-Scoped)

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents                  list agents in this project
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents                  create agent
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}       read agent
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}       update agent (name, prompt, labels, annotations)
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}       soft delete

POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/start     start — creates Session (idempotent; one active at a time)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/start     preview start context (dry run — no session created)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/sessions  session run history
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/inbox     read inbox (unread first)
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/inbox     send message to this agent's inbox
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/inbox/{msg_id}   mark message read
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/inbox/{msg_id}   delete message

GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/role_bindings    RBAC bindings
```

#### Ignite Response

`POST /projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/start` is idempotent:
- If a session is already active, it is returned as-is.
- If no active session exists, a new one is created.
- Unread Inbox messages are drained (marked read) and injected into the start context.

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "2abc...",
    "agent_id": "1def...",
    "phase": "pending",
    "triggered_by_user_id": "...",
    "created_at": "2026-03-20T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "start_context": "# Agent: API\n\nYou are API...\n\n## Inbox\n...\n\n## Task\n..."
}
```

The start context assembles in order:
1. `Project.prompt` (workspace context — shared by all agents in this project)
2. `Agent.prompt` (who you are)
3. Drained Inbox messages (what others have asked you to do)
4. `Session.prompt` (what this run is focused on)
5. Peer Agent roster with latest status

### Sessions

Sessions are not directly creatable.

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions                                              list sessions
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}                                         read session
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}                                         cancel or delete session

GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/messages                                list user messages sent to this session
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/messages                                push a user message (enqueues to runner delivery queue)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/agui/events                             SSE durable AG-UI event stream (DB replay + live; excludes superseded rows)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/agui/events?since=<seq>                 SSE from seq (client reconnect — no full replay)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/agui/events?run_id=<id>                 SSE filtered to a single run
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/events                                  SSE live event stream proxied from runner pod (ephemeral — no replay)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/role_bindings                           RBAC bindings
```

#### Workspace Files

Read and write files in a running session's workspace. Session must be in `Running` phase.

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workspace                               list workspace files
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workspace/*path                         read file content
PUT    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workspace/*path                         write file content
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workspace/*path                         delete file
```

#### Pre-Upload Files

Stage files into S3 before the session pod starts. Files are hydrated into the workspace at start time. Max 10 MB per file.

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/files                                   list staged files
PUT    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/files/*path                             stage a file
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/files/*path                             remove staged file
```

#### Git

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/git/status                              git status in session workspace
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/git/configure-remote                    configure git remote
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/git/branches                            list branches
```

#### Repos

Attach additional repositories to a session workspace.

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/repos/status                            list attached repos and clone status
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/repos                                   attach an additional repo
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/repos/{repo_name}                       detach a repo
```

#### Operational

```
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/clone                                   clone session (new session from same config)
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/displayname                             update display name
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/model                                   switch active model
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workflow/metadata                       get active workflow and metadata
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/workflow                                select workflow
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/pod-events                              Kubernetes pod events for this session
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/oauth/{provider}/url                    get OAuth redirect URL for provider
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/export                                  export session transcript
```

#### Runner Protocol

These endpoints proxy directly to the runner pod. Session must be in `Running` phase. Returns `502` if the runner is unreachable.

```
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/interrupt                               interrupt the active run
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/feedback                                submit feedback event (Langfuse)
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/capabilities                            runner framework and capabilities
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/mcp/status                              MCP server instance status
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/tasks                                   list background tasks
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/tasks/{task_id}/output                  get task output (max 10 MB)
POST   /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/tasks/{task_id}/stop                    stop background task
```

### Credentials (Project-Scoped)

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials                           list credentials in this project
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials?provider={provider}       filter by provider
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials                           create a credential
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}                 read credential (metadata only; token never returned)
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}                 update credential
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}                 soft delete
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}/token           fetch raw token — restricted to credential:token-reader
```

`token` is accepted on `POST` and `PATCH` but **never returned** by the standard read endpoints. It is stored encrypted in the database. The database row is the authoritative store; a future Vault integration can be adopted by pointing the row at a Vault path without changing the API surface.

`GET /projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}/token` is the **only** endpoint that returns the raw token. It is gated by the `credential:token-reader` role — a platform-internal role granted only to runner service accounts at session start. Human users and service accounts do not hold this role by default. Credential CRUD is governed by the caller's project-level role (e.g. `project:owner`, `project:editor`).

#### Provider Enum

| Provider | Service | Token type | `url` | `email` |
|----------|---------|------------|-------|---------|
| `github` | GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise | Personal Access Token | optional; required for GHE | — |
| `gitlab` | GitLab.com or self-hosted | Personal Access Token | optional; required for self-hosted | — |
| `jira` | Jira Cloud (Atlassian) | API Token | required (Atlassian instance URL) | required (used in Basic auth) |
| `google` | Google Cloud / Workspace | Service Account JSON serialized to string | — | — |

#### Token Response Shape (Runner)

When a runner fetches a credential, the response payload shape is consistent across providers:

```json
{ "provider": "gitlab", "token": "glpat-...",       "url": "https://gitlab.myco.com" }
{ "provider": "github", "token": "github_pat_...",  "url": "https://github.com" }
{ "provider": "jira",   "token": "ATATT3x...",      "url": "https://myco.atlassian.net", "email": "bot@myco.com" }
{ "provider": "google", "token": "{\"type\":\"service_account\", ...}" }
```

`token` is always present. `url` and `email` are included when set. Google's token field carries the full Service Account JSON serialized as a string.

## RBAC

### Scopes

| Scope | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `global` | Applies across the entire platform |
| `project` | Applies to all resources in a project (Agents, Sessions, Credentials) |
| `agent` | Applies to one Agent and all its sessions |
| `session` | Applies to one session run only |

Effective permissions = union of all applicable bindings (global ∪ project ∪ agent ∪ session). No deny rules.

#### Credential Access — Project-Scoped by Default

Credentials belong to a project. All agents in the project share the project's credentials automatically — no explicit sharing or per-credential RoleBindings needed. At session start, the resolver lists all credentials in the agent's project and returns the matching credential for each requested provider.

This follows the Kubernetes resource model:

| Ambient | Kubernetes Analogy | Relationship |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Project | Namespace | Isolation boundary, owns child resources |
| Agent | Deployment | Mutable definition, runs workloads |
| Session | Pod | Ephemeral execution, created from Agent |
| Credential | Secret | Project-scoped secret, available to all workloads in the namespace |

Named patterns:
- **Project Robot Account** — credential created in a project; all agents use it automatically.
- **Multi-project credential** — create the same credential (same PAT) in multiple projects. Each project gets its own Credential record.
- **No credential** — projects without credentials simply run sessions without provider integrations.

### Built-in Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `platform:admin` | Full access to everything |
| `platform:viewer` | Read-only across the platform |
| `project:owner` | Full control of a project and all its agents |
| `project:editor` | Create/update Agents, ignite, send messages |
| `project:viewer` | Read-only within a project |
| `agent:operator` | Ignite and message a specific Agent |
| `agent:editor` | Update prompt and metadata on a specific Agent |
| `agent:observer` | Read a specific Agent and its sessions |
| `agent:runner` | Minimum viable pod credential: read agent, push messages, send inbox |
| `credential:token-reader` | Fetch the raw token via `GET /projects/{id}/credentials/{cred_id}/token`. Granted only to runner service accounts at session start. Human users do not hold this role. |

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Projects | Agents | Sessions | Inbox | Credentials | Home | RBAC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `platform:admin` | full | full | full | full | full | full | full |
| `platform:viewer` | read/list | read/list | read/list | — | read/list | read | read/list |
| `project:owner` | full | full | full | full | full | read | project+agent bindings |
| `project:editor` | read | create/update/ignite | read/list | send/read | create/update/delete | read | — |
| `project:viewer` | read | read/list | read/list | — | read/list | read | — |
| `agent:operator` | — | update/ignite | read/list | send/read | — | — | — |
| `agent:editor` | — | update | — | — | — | — | — |
| `agent:observer` | — | read | read/list | — | — | — | — |
| `agent:runner` | — | read | read | send | — | — | — |
| `credential:token-reader` | — | — | — | — | token: read | — | — |

### RBAC Endpoints

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/roles
GET    /api/ambient/v1/roles/{id}
POST   /api/ambient/v1/roles
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/roles/{id}
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/roles/{id}

GET    /api/ambient/v1/role_bindings
POST   /api/ambient/v1/role_bindings
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/role_bindings/{id}

GET    /api/ambient/v1/users/{id}/role_bindings
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/role_bindings
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/agents/{agent_id}/role_bindings
GET    /api/ambient/v1/sessions/{id}/role_bindings
```

The `credential:token-reader` role is granted to the runner service account by the platform at session start. It is never granted via user-facing `POST /role_bindings`. It is a platform-internal binding managed by the operator. Credential CRUD is governed by the caller's project-level role — `project:owner` and `project:editor` can create/update/delete credentials; `project:viewer` can list/read metadata.

---

### ScheduledSessions (Project-Scoped)

```
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions                              list
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions                              create
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}                   read
PATCH  /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}                   update (schedule, session_prompt, enabled, timezone, description)
DELETE /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}                   delete

POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}/suspend           disable — sets enabled=false
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}/resume            enable  — sets enabled=true
POST   /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}/trigger           immediate one-off ignite outside cron schedule
GET    /api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/scheduled-sessions/{sched_id}/runs              list Sessions triggered by this schedule
```

---

### Generic Proxy

All backend paths not mapped to a native `/api/ambient/v1/...` endpoint are forwarded verbatim to the backend service. The API server authenticates the caller, injects service credentials, then proxies the request — preserving method, path, query string, body, and response status.

This allows SDK and CLI clients to reach the full backend surface through a single authenticated endpoint without requiring every backend route to be natively implemented in the API server. Routes listed here are candidates for future native spec entries.

```

## Labels and Annotations

Every first-class Kind carries two JSONB columns:

| Column | Purpose | Example values |
|---|---|---|
| `labels` | Queryable key/value tags. Use for filtering, grouping, and selection. | `{"env": "prod", "team": "platform", "tier": "critical"}` |
| `annotations` | Freeform key/value metadata. Use for tooling notes, human remarks, external references. | `{"last-reviewed": "2026-03-21", "jira": "PLAT-123", "owner-slack": "@mturansk"}` |

**Kinds with `labels` + `annotations`:** User, Project, Agent, Session, Credential

**Kinds without:** Inbox (ephemeral message queue), SessionMessage (append-only event stream), Role, RoleBinding (RBAC internals — structured by design)

### Design: JSONB over EAV or separate tables

Instead of a separate `metadata` table (requires joins) or a polymorphic EAV table (breaks referential integrity), metadata is stored inline in the row it describes. This is the modern hybrid approach:

- **Zero joins**: Data is co-located with the resource.
- **Infinite flexibility**: Every row can carry different keys — no schema migration required to add a new label key.
- **GIN-indexed**: PostgreSQL JSONB supports `GIN` (Generalized Inverted Index), making containment queries (`@>`) nearly as fast as standard column lookups at scale.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_labels     ON projects     USING GIN (labels);
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_labels       ON agents       USING GIN (labels);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_labels     ON sessions     USING GIN (labels);
CREATE INDEX idx_credentials_labels  ON credentials  USING GIN (labels);
```

### Query patterns

```sql
-- Find all sessions tagged env=prod
SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE labels @> '{"env": "prod"}';

-- Find all Agents owned by a team
SELECT * FROM agents WHERE labels @> '{"team": "platform"}';

-- Read a single annotation
SELECT annotations->>'jira' FROM projects WHERE id = 'my-project';
```

### Convention

- `labels` keys should be short, lowercase, hyphenated (e.g. `env`, `team`, `tier`, `managed-by`).
- `annotations` keys should use reverse-DNS namespacing for tooling (e.g. `ambient.io/last-sync`, `github.com/pr`).
- Neither column enforces a schema — validation is the caller's responsibility.
- Default value: `{}` (empty object). Never `null`.

## The Model as a String Tree

Every node in this model is an **ID and a string**. That is the complete primitive.

A `Project` is an ID and a `prompt` string — the workspace context.
An `Agent` is an ID and a `prompt` string — who the agent is.
A `Session` is an ID and a `prompt` string — what this run is focused on.
An `InboxMessage` is an ID and a `body` string — a request addressed to an agent.
A `SessionEvent` is an ID and a `payload` string — one AG-UI event in the conversation stream.
A `SessionMessage` is an ID and a `payload` string — one user message in the runner delivery queue.

Strings can be simple (`"hello world"`) or arbitrarily complex (a bookmarked system prompt, a structured markdown context block, a multi-section briefing). The model does not care. Every node is still just an ID and a string.

This means the entire data model is a **composable JSON tree** — four nodes, each an ID and a string:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "id": "ambient-platform",
    "prompt": "This workspace builds the Ambient platform API server in Go. All agents operate on the same codebase. Prefer small, focused PRs. All code must pass gofmt, go vet, and golangci-lint before commit.",
    "labels": { "env": "prod", "team": "platform" },
    "annotations": { "github.com/repo": "ambient/platform" }
  },
  "agent": {
    "id": "01HXYZ...",
    "name": "be",
    "prompt": "You are a backend engineer specializing in Go REST APIs and Kubernetes operators. You write idiomatic Go, prefer explicit error handling over panic, and follow the plugin architecture in components/ambient-api-server/plugins/. You never use the service account client directly — always GetK8sClientsForRequest.",
    "labels": { "role": "backend", "lang": "go" },
    "annotations": { "ambient.io/specialty": "grpc,rest,k8s" }
  },
  "inbox": [
    {
      "id": "01HDEF...",
      "from": "overlord",
      "body": "While you're in the sessions plugin, also harden the subresource handler — agent_id is interpolated directly into a TSL search string."
    },
    {
      "id": "01HGHI...",
      "from": null,
      "body": "The presenter nil-pointer in projectAgents and inbox needs a guard before this goes to staging."
    }
  ],
  "session": {
    "id": "01HABC...",
    "prompt": "Implement WatchSessionMessages gRPC handler with SSE fan-out and replay. Replay all existing messages to new subscribers before switching to live delivery. Repo: github.com/ambient/platform, path: components/ambient-api-server/plugins/sessions/.",
    "labels": { "wave": "3", "feature": "session-messages" },
    "annotations": { "github.com/pr": "ambient/platform#142" }
  },
  "message": {
    "event_type": "user",
    "payload": "Begin. Start with the gRPC handler, then wire SSE, then write the integration test."
  }
}
```

### Composition

Because every node is a string, **entire agent suites and workspaces compose declaratively**.

The start context pipeline is string composition — each scope inherits and narrows the string above it:

```
Project.prompt        → workspace context (shared by all agents)
  Agent.prompt        → who this agent is
    Inbox messages    → what others have asked (queued intent)
      Session.prompt  → what this run is focused on
```

To compose a new workspace: write a `Project.prompt`. To define a new agent role: write an `Agent.prompt` and create the Agent in the project. To start: the system assembles the full context string automatically, in order, from the tree.

A different `Project.prompt` = a different team with different shared context.
An Agent with the same name in two projects = the same role operating in two different workspaces (separate records, independently mutable).
A poke (`InboxMessage.body`) sent from one Agent to another = a string crossing a node boundary.

This structure means you can define and compose bespoke agent suites — entire fleets with different roles, different workspace contexts, different session scopes — purely by composing strings at the right node in the tree. The platform assembles the start context; the model does the rest.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Agent is project-scoped, not global | Simplicity. An agent's identity and prompt are contextual to the project it serves. No indirection via a global registry. |
| Agent.prompt is mutable | Prompt editing is a routine operational task. RBAC controls who can change it. No versioning overhead. |
| Agent ownership via RBAC, not a hardcoded FK | Ownership is expressed as a RoleBinding (`scope=agent`, `scope_id=agent_id`). Enables multi-owner and delegated ownership consistently across all Kinds. |
| Credential is project-scoped, like a Kubernetes Secret | Credentials live inside a project. All agents in the project share them automatically. Duplication across projects is intentional and explicit — each project gets its own Credential record, same as Kubernetes Secrets in different Namespaces. |
| Credential token is write-only | Prevents token exfiltration via the standard REST API. Raw token only surfaced to runners via the runtime credentials path, not to end users. |
| Four-scope RBAC (`global`, `project`, `agent`, `session`) | Credential access is implicit via project membership — no dedicated `credential` scope needed. Simpler model with fewer moving parts. |
| Credential CRUD governed by project roles | `project:owner` and `project:editor` can manage credentials. No separate `credential:owner` / `credential:reader` roles — project roles cover it. |
| One active Session per Agent | Avoids concurrent conflicting runs; start is idempotent |
| Inbox on Agent, not Session | Messages persist across re-ignitions; addressed to the agent, not the run |
| Inbox drained at start | Unread messages become part of the start context; session picks up where things left off |
| `current_session_id` denormalized on Agent | Project Home reads Agent + session phase without joining through sessions |
| Sessions created only via start | Sessions are run artifacts; direct `POST /sessions` does not exist |
| Every layer carries a `prompt` | Project.prompt = workspace context; Agent.prompt = who the agent is; Session.prompt = what this run does; Inbox = prior requests. Pokes roll downhill. |
| `SessionMessage` is the runner delivery queue only | Narrowed from "event log" to "user message delivery queue". The `WatchSessionMessages` watcher already discarded non-user events (line 215 of `grpc_transport.py`) — the table now matches that contract. Prevents dual-store confusion. |
| `SessionEvent` is separate from `SessionMessage` | The two stores flow in opposite directions and have different consumers. `session_messages`: user → runner (delivery queue, consumed by gRPC watch). `session_events`: runner → DB (event log, consumed by SSE replay and CLI/SDK history). Merging them required overloading one direction to serve both, which `grpc_push_middleware` did badly. |
| `run_id` and `thread_id` are first-class columns in `SessionEvent` | The legacy `agui-events.jsonl` had no per-run filtering. `run_id` enables per-run compaction (mark streaming deltas `superseded=true`, append `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT`) and per-run queries (`?run_id=<id>`). `thread_id` ties DB rows back to runner in-memory streams for debugging. |
| Compaction uses `superseded` flag, not row deletion | Deleting compacted rows would require transaction coordination with concurrent readers. Marking `superseded=true` is append-safe and lets queries add `WHERE NOT superseded`. Superseded types: `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `TOOL_CALL_ARGS`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, `STATE_DELTA`, `ACTIVITY_DELTA`. Non-delta events (`STEP_*`, `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_END`, lifecycle) are never superseded. `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` is appended as the canonical transcript; `STATE_SNAPSHOT` and `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` are appended if state/activity were tracked. |
| `session_events.seq` is a global BIGSERIAL, not per-session | Per-session sequences require either a transaction-level sequence generator per session or application-level locking. A global BIGSERIAL with a `(session_id, seq)` index provides ordered per-session reads without any locking overhead. `seq` values are globally unique and monotonically increasing — they are not contiguous within a session, but they form a stable cursor for `?since=<seq>` reconnect. |
| `payload` is raw AG-UI JSON piped verbatim | The legacy backend's `GET /sessions/{id}/messages` SSE wrapped DB records in a custom envelope — wrong format for AG-UI protocol consumers. `session_events.payload` stores the original JSON; SSE emits `data: {payload}\n\n` directly. Zero transformation means any AG-UI client can consume the stream without adapter code. |
| `SessionEvent` replaces `agui-events.jsonl` entirely | The JSONL was durable (PVC-backed) but lost on PVC deletion, required O(file-size) reads for history, and could not serve multiple readers without an in-memory broadcast pipe. A DB table gives durability, indexed queries, multi-reader fan-out via gRPC watch, and compaction without atomic-rename hacks. |
| `SessionMessage` is append-only | Canonical record of user messages sent to the session; never edited or deleted |
| `agent:editor` role | Allows prompt updates without full operator access |
| `agent:runner` role | Pods get minimum viable credential: read agent definition, push session messages, send inbox |
| Union-only permissions | No deny rules — simpler mental model for fleet operators |
| CLI mirrors API 1-for-1 | Every endpoint has a corresponding command; status tracked explicitly |
| This document is the spec | A reconciler will compare the spec (this doc) against code status and surface gaps |
| `labels` / `annotations` are JSONB, not strings | Enables GIN-indexed key/value queries (`@>` operator) without joins; every row carries its own metadata without a separate EAV table. `labels` = queryable tags; `annotations` = freeform notes. Applied to first-class Kinds: User, Project, Agent, Session. Not applied to Inbox, SessionMessage, Role/RoleBinding. |

## Credential — Usage

```sh
# Create a GitLab PAT — token via env var (avoids shell history exposure)
acpctl credential create --name my-gitlab-pat --provider gitlab \
  --token "$GITLAB_PAT" --url https://gitlab.myco.com
# credential/my-gitlab-pat created

# Token via stdin (also avoids shell history)
echo "$GITLAB_PAT" | acpctl credential create --name my-gitlab-pat --provider gitlab \
  --token @- --url https://gitlab.myco.com

# List credentials
acpctl credential list
# NAME              PROVIDER  URL                      CREATED
# my-gitlab-pat     gitlab    https://gitlab.myco.com  2026-03-31

# Rotate a token
acpctl credential update my-gitlab-pat --token "$GITLAB_PAT_NEW"

# Declarative apply — token sourced from env var
```

```yaml
kind: Credential
metadata:
  name: platform-gitlab-pat
spec:
  provider: gitlab
  token: $GITLAB_PAT
  url: https://gitlab.myco.com
  labels:
    team: platform
```

```sh
acpctl project my-project
acpctl apply -f credential.yaml
# credential/platform-gitlab-pat created (in project my-project)
```

## Design Decisions — Credential

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Credential is project-scoped | Follows the Kubernetes Secret-in-Namespace pattern. All agents in the project share credentials implicitly. No RoleBindings needed for sharing within a project. |
| Token stored in database, encrypted at rest | Single authoritative store. A future Vault integration can be adopted by pointing the DB row at a Vault path without changing the API surface. |
| `google` token serialized as a string | Service Account JSON is serialized into the single `token` field. Keeps the schema uniform across all providers. |
| No validation on creation | First-use error is acceptable. Avoids a network call to the provider at creation time and the failure modes that come with it. |
| Credential rotation is user-managed | Users update the token via `PATCH` or `acpctl credential update`. No platform-side rotation or expiry tracking. |
| No migration utility for existing K8s Secrets | Users re-enter credentials via the new API. The old Secret-based path is removed when the new API is live. |
| Dedicated tokens, not personal credentials | Users are expected to create dedicated Robot Accounts or PATs for each project, not share their personal credentials. Each project gets its own Credential records. |

### Labels/Annotations — SDK Ergonomics Gap

All Kinds with `labels`/`annotations` store them as JSON strings in the DB (`*string` in the Go model) but as structured maps in the OpenAPI schema. The Go SDK type carries `Labels *string` / `Annotations *string` (matching the DB column). Consumers doing label/annotation operations must marshal/unmarshal the JSON string themselves — there are no typed `PatchLabels`/`PatchAnnotations` helper methods in the SDK.

**Workaround:** Use `Update(ctx, id, map[string]any{"labels": labelsMap, "annotations": annotationsMap})`. The API server accepts the map directly and stores it as JSON.

**Permanent fix:** Add `PatchLabels` / `PatchAnnotations` typed helpers to `SessionAPI`, `ProjectAgentAPI`, and `ProjectAPI` in the SDK — these should accept `map[string]string` and call `Update` internally.

### CLI — Known Gaps vs Spec

| Command | Status | Path to close |
|---|---|---|
| `PATCH /projects/{id}` | 🔲 no CLI project-patch command | add `acpctl project update` subcommand |
| Project/Agent/Session label subcommands | 🔲 no `acpctl label`/`acpctl annotate` | add typed label helpers to SDK first, then CLI |
| `GET /roles`, `GET /role_bindings` | 🔲 list/get not exposed | add to `get` command resource switch |
| `DELETE /role_bindings/{id}` | 🔲 not exposed | add to `delete` command resource switch |
